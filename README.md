# Python-for-Data-Science

This repository consists of a notebook with the very basics of Python (Notebook 1).
The second notebook (Notebook 2) explains the various libraries and plotting techniques used for Data Science.

You will need to import prime.py for running (Notebook 1) and also iris dataset which is a csv file which will be used for (Notebook2).
I have uploaded both the files.

#This repository also contains detailed assignments and the answers to all the questions. Feel free to go through
